# SustainAble-Energy-Tracking-App
SustainAble application developed as part of my final year project at university. It is an iOS application using a 3-tier architecture pattern, with Google Firebase being used as the backend.

The application is designed to help users reduce their carbon footprint by tracking how much energy they use per day - recieving feedback on how they have done based on the number of activites, what device they were performed on, and for how long.
